# Agent Instruction Guide: Multi-Model Image Orchestration

## Overview

This guide explains how to create modular, maintainable agent instructions that can intelligently orchestrate multiple AI image models through MCP tools. The approach separates **tool knowledge** from **agent behavior**, making instructions scalable and easy to maintain.

## Core Philosophy

### **Separation of Concerns**
- **Tool Knowledge**: What tools exist, their capabilities, and parameters
- **Agent Behavior**: How to interpret user intent and select tools
- **Orchestration Logic**: How to coordinate multiple tools for complex tasks

### **Design Principles**
1. **Single Source of Truth**: Tool documentation lives in one place
2. **Intent-Driven**: Agent focuses on understanding user goals
3. **Model Agnostic**: Agent works with any tool that matches capability requirements
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity as needed

## Architecture Overview

```
User Request → Intent Detection → Tool Selection → Parameter Mapping → Multi-Tool Execution → Result Aggregation
```

## Section 2: Intent Detection Framework

### **Intent Categories**
```markdown
## Intent Detection Matrix

### Primary Intents
| Intent | Keywords | Typical Tools | Output Expectation |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Generate** | create, make, generate, produce, imagine | Text-to-Image tools | New image(s) from description |
| **Edit** | edit, modify, transform, change, adjust | Image Editing tools | Modified version of input image |
| **Variants** | variations, alternatives, versions, similar, different | Image Variant tools | Multiple versions of input image |
| **Enhance** | enhance, improve, upscale, quality, refine | Enhancement tools | Higher quality/better version |
| **Compare** | compare, versus, which is better, show me options | Multiple tools | Side-by-side results |

### Secondary Modifiers
| Modifier | Keywords | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **Style** | artistic, realistic, cartoon, oil painting, photo | Influences model selection |
| **Quality** | high quality, best, professional, detailed | Prioritizes high-resolution models |
| **Speed** | quick, fast, immediate | Prioritizes faster models |
| **Quantity** | multiple, several, options, choices | Generates multiple variants |
```

### **Intent Detection Logic**
```markdown
## Intent Detection Algorithm

1. **Analyze User Message**: Look for primary intent keywords
2. **Identify Modifiers**: Extract style, quality, speed requirements
3. **Check for Context**: Determine if this is a follow-up or new request
4. **Confirm Ambiguity**: Ask for clarification if intent is unclear

### Examples
- "Create a landscape painting" → Generate + Artistic Style
- "Make this photo look better" → Enhance + High Quality
- "Show me different versions of this image" → Variants + Multiple Options
- "Edit this image to look like a cartoon" → Edit + Artistic Style
```

## Section 4: Model Selection Strategy

### **Decision Tree Framework**
```markdown
## Model Selection Logic

### For Image Generation
```
User wants artistic/creative image?
├─ Yes → openai_4o_image (vivid style, multiple variants)
└─ No → User wants realistic image?
   ├─ Yes → qwen_image (natural style, fast)
   └─ No → User needs highest resolution?
      ├─ Yes → bytedance_seedream_image (4K support)
      └─ No → openai_4o_image (good balance)
```

### For Image Editing
```
User needs complex editing with masks?
├─ Yes → openai_4o_image (mask support)
└─ No → User has multiple images to edit?
   ├─ Yes → bytedance_seedream_image (batch editing)
   └─ No → User needs speed?
      ├─ Yes → nano_banana_edit (fastest)
      └─ No → qwen_image (good balance)
```

### For Image Enhancement
```
User needs upscaling?
├─ Yes → nano_banana_upscale (up to 4x, face enhancement)
└─ No → Consider regeneration with higher quality settings
```

### **Multi-Model Strategy**
```markdown
## When to Use Multiple Models

### Comparison Tasks
- "Show me this in different styles" → Use 2-3 models with different style settings
- "Which model works best for this?" → Same prompt across multiple models
- "Give me options" → Generate variants from different models

### Quality Assurance
- "I need the best possible result" → Generate with multiple models, recommend best
- "Professional work" → Use high-resolution models + fallback options
- "Quick preview + final version" → Fast model for preview, slow model for final

### Creative Exploration
- "Surprise me" → Use different models with creative interpretations
- "Artistic variations" → Each model's unique style interpretation
```

4. **Recover**: Continue with alternative or ask for guidance

### Parameter Validation
1. **Pre-check**: Validate parameters before tool calls
2. **Correct**: Auto-fix common issues (aspect ratios, sizes)
3. **Clarify**: Ask user for ambiguous requirements
4. **Document**: Learn from corrections for future requests

### Quality Assurance
1. **Preview**: Show quick results when possible
2. **Validate**: Check if results meet user requirements
3. **Iterate**: Offer refinements if needed
